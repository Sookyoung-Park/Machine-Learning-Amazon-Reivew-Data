# Machine-Learning-Final-Project-with-Amazon-Reivew-Data
Welcome to my machine learning project using Pyhton!

---

## Description
This project is a machine learning model built using Python. The model is designed to predict overall rating based on reviewText, and has been trained on a large dataset to ensure accuracy. It is focused on implementing Binary and Multiclass Classifiers and clustering Technique.

## Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website.
After installing Python, you can download the project files from GitHub by clicking on the "Download" button on this page, or by cloning the repository.

## Usage
To use this machine learning model, you can simply run the file in your Python environment. You will need to provide the input data in the format specified in the file, and the model will return the predicted output. Plus you need the same data set as I used for implemeting.
